# Fingerprint Authentication

This repo contains the code for fingerprint classification and authentication. This code is part of our Final Year Project at the _Lebanese American University_.

## Required Dataset:

The NIST dataset of fingerprint images contains **2000 8-bit gray scale fingerprint image pairs**. Each image is 512-by-512 pixels with 32 rows of white space at the bottom and classified using one of the five following classes: 
1. A=Arch
2. L=Left Loop
3. R=Right Loop
4. T=Tented Arch
5. W=Whorl.

The dataset is evenly distributed over each of the five classifications with **400 fingerprint pairs from each class**.

**The dataset can be downloaded from: [NIST 8-Bit Gray Scale Images of Fingerprint Image Groups (FIGS)](https://academictorrents.com/details/d7e67e86f0f936773f217dbbb9c149c4d98748c6)**
